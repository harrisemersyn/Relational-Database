A project written in C. This is the creation of a relational database from scratch. For the project, we were given a list of students,
their addresses, IDs, courses they were in, times of the courses, days of the courses, and grades of the courses. Then we had to create
a program to make queries from the relational database, and then demonstrate projection,  joining, and selection.

Notes:
-We were not given a file to read from, so that's why all of the information used is hard-coded into the main. 
-The '*' symbol represents any value.
